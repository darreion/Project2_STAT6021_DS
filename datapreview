**Exclusion of Data** 

`Latitude` and `longitude` are important metrics when evaluating housing data, specifically for location-based analysis. 

For our analysis of  KIng’s County housing data, we’ve excluded data pertaining to `longitude` and `latitude` to focus on our comparative analysis focusing on primarily non-location-based factors. Moreover, in our analysis, we evaluate each property type based on similar and contrasting attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square feet. 

After loading the dataset in RStudio, we concluded with a visual inspection of the data and found a potential of the `sqft_living` variable matching as the exact sum of the ` sqft_above` and `sqft_below`.  To assess the likelihood of the scenario we created new columns and computed the data of the variables, and created a `boolean` response to verify our assumption (see below), 

**Removal of Redundant Data**
```{r} 
library(tidyverse) 

Data<-read.csv("kc_house_data.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE) 

summary(Data) 

Data_cleaned <- na.omit(Data) 

Data_cleaned$equal <- ifelse(Data_cleaned$sqft_above + Data_cleaned$sqft_basement == Data_cleaned$sqft_living, "yes", "no") 

summary(Data_cleaned$equal) 

table(Data_cleaned$equal) 
``` 

Through our data discovery process, we determined the removal of `sqft_above` and `sqft_below` and utilizing `sqft_living` would be appropriate in the minimization of predictor variables related to livable space within a King’s County property.
